# A thousand and one stars

A videogame where you are the hero.

# Minimal viable product target features

- DONE: galactic background
- Planets and special places
- Move characters
- Encounters
- End turn
- End game

# Issues


## Fixed

- the location takes the hover effect instead of the hero. There must be a way to know which one should be blocking the mouse.
	-> using collider 3d and set the z position of colliders to ensure they are interacted with in the right order.
